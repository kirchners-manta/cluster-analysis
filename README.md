# Cluster Analysis
Collection of input files relevant to our paper on cluster analysis. **Currently relevant to reviewers only!**

* The directory [simulations](simulations/) contains input files for the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of water (at the example of the 512 molecule system) performed with the [LAMMPS](http://lammps.sandia.gov/) program package.

* For details on the *ab initio* MD simulations please refer to our earlier publications on [water](https://doi.org/10.1524/zpch.2012.0327) and the [ionic liquid](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4887082).

* The directory [analysis](analysis/) contains an exemplary [input file](analysis/input.txt) for the cluster analysis as implemented in [TRAVIS](http://www.travis-analyzer.de/) and an additional [python script](analysis/csdf_formalism.py) for modified CSDF formalism (also implemented in TRAVIS, just given for convenience).
